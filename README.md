RFM Analysis in SQL
The “RFM” in RFM analysis stands for recency, frequency and monetary value. RFM analysis is a way to use data based on existing customer behavior to predict how a new customer is likely to act in the future. An RFM model is built using three key factors:  - how recently a customer has transacted with a brand
                                             - how frequently they’ve engaged with a brand
                                             - how much money they’ve spent on a brand’s products and services
I explored a sales dataset and generate various analytics and insights from customers' past purchase behavior. I went from analyzing sales revenue to creating a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM technique from basic SQL queries to exploring complex problems using SUB QUERY, CTEs, AGGREGATE, and WINDOW functions.
